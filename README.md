#rvaughan74's Ludum Dare Jam 49 attempt project

This project was started to enter [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49) for the 72 hour Jam competition. I took this as an opportunity to both expand my portfolio and learn the Godot Game engine while following BornCG's 2D Platformer videos [in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ).
